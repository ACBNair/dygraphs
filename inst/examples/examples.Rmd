Here are all the deaths:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=2}
library(dygraphs)
dygraph(ldeaths, group = "lungs")
```

As you can see there were a lot of deaths.

Here are the male and female deaths:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=2}
dygraph(mdeaths, group = "lungs")
dygraph(fdeaths, group = "lungs")
```

As you can see there is some contrast between the genders.
