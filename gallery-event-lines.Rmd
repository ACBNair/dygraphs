title: "Event Lines"

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
```

Event lines are a useful way to note points within a time series where noteworty events occurred. For example, in the following graph we overlay the dates which saw the first deployment of US combat troops to Korea and Vietnam over a plot of US presidential approval ratings: 

```{r}
dygraph(presidents, main = "Quarterly Presidential Approval Ratings") %>%
  dyAxis("y", valueRange = c(0, 100)) %>%
  dyEvent(date = "1950-6-30", "Korea", labelLoc = "bottom") %>%
  dyEvent(date = "1965-2-09", "Vietnam", labelLoc = "bottom")
```

Note that we specify that our event labels go at the bottom of the graph so they don't interfere with the legend, and set the y-axis `valueRange` to ensure that there is adequate room at the bottom for the labels.
