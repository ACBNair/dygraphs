```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
```

**NOTE:** Candlestick charts are currently only available in the development version of dygraphs. You can install the development version as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/dygraphs")
```

You can create candlestick/OHLC charts with `dyCandlestick` function. For example:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(xts)
data(sample_matrix)
m <- tail(sample_matrix, n = 32)
dygraph(m) %>%
  dyCandlestick()
```

Candlestick charts use the first four data series to plot, the rest of the data series (if
any) are rendered with line plotter:

```{r message=FALSE}
m <- cbind(m, apply(m[, 1:3], 1, mean))
colnames(m)[5] <- "Mean"
dygraph(m) %>%
  dyCandlestick()
```
