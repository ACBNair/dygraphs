title: "Range Selector"
---

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
```

You can add range selector to the bottom of a dygraph that provides a straightforward interface for panning and zooming. For example:

```{r}
dygraph(nhtemp, main = "New Haven Temperatures")  %>% 
  dyRangeSelector()
```

You can also specify an initial date range for the range selector:

```{r}
dygraph(nhtemp, main = "New Haven Temperatures")  %>% 
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("1920-01-01", "1960-01-01"))
```

Note that the `dateWindow` parameter should be a two-element vector of `POSIXct` (or objects that can unambiguously converted to POSIXct).

Several other options affect the appearance of the range selector:

```{r}
dygraph(nhtemp, main = "New Haven Temperatures")  %>% 
  dyRangeSelector(height = 20, strokeColor = "")
```
