\usage{
dyOptions(stackedGraph = FALSE, stepPlot = FALSE, fillGraph = FALSE,
  drawPoints = FALSE, pointSize = 1, strokeWidth = 1,
  strokePattern = NULL, strokeBorderWidth = NULL,
  strokeBorderColor = "white", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{stackedGraph}{If set, stack series on top of one another rather than
drawing them independently. The first series specified in the input data
will wind up on top of the chart and the last will be on bottom.}

\item{stepPlot}{When set, display the graph as a step plot instead of a line
plot. This option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{fillGraph}{Should the area underneath the graph be filled? This option
is not compatible with error bars. This option can also be set on a
per-series basis.}

\item{drawPoints}{Draw a small dot at each point, in addition to a line going
through the point. This makes the individual data points easier to see, but
can increase visual clutter in the chart. This option can also be set on a
per-series basis.}

\item{pointSize}{The size of the dot to draw on each point in pixels. A dot
is always drawn when a point is "isolated", i.e. there is a missing point
on either side of it. This also controls the size of those dots. This
option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{strokeWidth}{The width of the lines connecting data points. This can be
used to increase the contrast or some graphs. This option can also be set
on a per-series basis.}

\item{strokePattern}{A custom pattern array where the even index is a draw
and odd is a space in pixels. If null then it draws a solid line. The array
should have a even length as any odd lengthed array could be expressed as a
smaller even length array. This is used to create dashed lines. This option
can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{strokeBorderWidth}{Draw a border around graph lines to make crossing
lines more easily distinguishable. Useful for graphs with many lines. This
option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{strokeBorderColor}{Color for the line border used if
\code{strokeBorderWidth} is set. This option can also be set on a
per-series basis.}

\item{...}{Additional options to pass directly to dygraphs (see the
  \href{http://dygraphs.com/options.html}{dygraphs documentation} for
  additional details).}
