dyOptions(stackedGraph = FALSE, stepPlot = FALSE, fillGraph = FALSE,
  fillAlpha = 0.15, drawPoints = FALSE, pointSize = 1, strokeWidth = 1,
  strokePattern = NULL, strokeBorderWidth = NULL,
  strokeBorderColor = "white", colorValue = 0.5, colorSaturation = 1,

  gridLineColor = NULL, gridLineWidth = 0.3, css = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{stackedGraph}{If set, stack series on top of one another rather than
drawing them independently. The first series specified in the input data
will wind up on top of the chart and the last will be on bottom.}

\item{stepPlot}{When set, display the graph as a step plot instead of a line
plot. This option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{fillGraph}{Should the area underneath the graph be filled? This option
is not compatible with error bars. This option can also be set on a
per-series basis.}

\item{fillAlpha}{Transparency for filled regions of the plot. A value of 0.0
means that the fill will not be drawn, whereas a value of 1.0 means that
the fill will be as dark as the line of the series itself.}

\item{drawPoints}{Draw a small dot at each point, in addition to a line going
through the point. This makes the individual data points easier to see, but
can increase visual clutter in the chart. This option can also be set on a
per-series basis.}

\item{pointSize}{The size of the dot to draw on each point in pixels. A dot
is always drawn when a point is "isolated", i.e. there is a missing point
on either side of it. This also controls the size of those dots. This
option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{strokeWidth}{The width of the lines connecting data points. This can be
used to increase the contrast or some graphs. This option can also be set
on a per-series basis.}

\item{strokePattern}{A custom pattern array where the even index is a draw
and odd is a space in pixels. If null then it draws a solid line. The array
should have a even length as any odd lengthed array could be expressed as a
smaller even length array. This is used to create dashed lines. This option
can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{strokeBorderWidth}{Draw a border around graph lines to make crossing
lines more easily distinguishable. Useful for graphs with many lines. This
option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{strokeBorderColor}{Color for the line border used if
\code{strokeBorderWidth} is set. This option can also be set on a
per-series basis.}

\item{colorValue}{If custom per-series colors are not specified, value of the
data series colors, as in hue/saturation/value (0.0-1.0, default 0.5).}

\item{colorSaturation}{If custom per-series colors are not specified,
saturation of the automatically-generated data series colors (0.0-1.0,
default 0.5).}

\item{drawXAxis}{Whether to draw the x-axis. Setting this to false also
prevents x-axis ticks from being drawn and reclaims the space for the chart
grid/lines.}

\item{drawYAxis}{Whether to draw the y-axis. Setting this to false also
prevents y-axis ticks from being drawn and reclaims the space for the chart
grid/lines.}

\item{includeZero}{Usually, dygraphs will use the range of the data plus some
padding to set the range of the y-axis. If this option is set, the y-axis
will always include zero, typically as the lowest value. This can be used
to avoid exaggerating the variance in the data.}

\item{axisLineColor}{Color of the x- and y-axis lines. Accepts any value
which the HTML canvas strokeStyle attribute understands, e.g. 'black' or
'rgb(0, 100, 255)'.}

\item{axisLineWidth}{Thickness (in pixels) of the x- and y-axis lines.}

\item{drawGrid}{Whether to display gridlines in the chart. This may be set on
a per-axis basis to define the visibility of each axis' grid separately.
Defaults to \code{TRUE} for x and y, and \code{FALSE} for y2.}

\item{gridLineColor}{The color of the gridlines. This option can also be set
on a per-series basis.}

\item{gridLineWidth}{Thickness (in pixels) of the gridlines drawn under the
chart.This option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{css}{Path to css file to be used for styling textual elements of the
graph. See the \href{http://dygraphs.com/css.html}{CSS documentation} on
the dygraphs website for additional details on which styles are available.
Note that CSS styles are global so will affect all dycharts on a given
web page.}

\item{...}{Additional options to pass directly to dygraphs (see the
  \href{http://dygraphs.com/options.html}{dygraphs documentation} for
  additional details).}
