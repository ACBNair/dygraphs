\usage{
dyAxis(dygraph, name, label = NULL, valueRange = NULL, ticker = NULL,
  pixelsPerLabel = NULL, axisLabelFormatter = NULL, drawGrid = NULL,
  gridLineColor = NULL, gridLineWidth = NULL, independentTicks = NULL,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dygraph}{Dygraph to add an axis definition to}

\item{name}{Axis name ('x', 'y', or 'y2')}

\item{label}{Label to display for axis (defaults to none).}

\item{valueRange}{Explicitly set the vertical range of the graph to
\code{c(low, high)}. This may be set on a per-axis basis to define each
y-axis separately. If either limit is unspecified, it will be calculated
automatically (e.g. \code{c(NULL, 30)} to automatically calculate just the
lower bound).}

\item{ticker}{This lets you specify an arbitrary JavaScript function to
generate tick marks on an axis. The tick marks are an array of (value,
label) pairs. The built-in functions go to great lengths to choose good
tick marks so, if you set this option, you'll most likely want to call one
of them and modify the result. See dygraph-tickers.js and the
\href{http://dygraphs.com/options.html}{dygraphs documentation} for
additional details).}

\item{pixelsPerLabel}{Number of pixels to require between each x- and
y-label. Larger values will yield a sparser axis with fewer ticks. Defaults
to 60 (x-axis) or 30 (y-axes).}

\item{axisLabelFormatter}{JavaScript function to call to format the tick
values that appear along an axis (see the
\href{http://dygraphs.com/options.html}{dygraphs documentation} for
additional details).}

\item{drawGrid}{Whether to display gridlines in the chart.}

\item{gridLineColor}{The color of the gridlines.}

\item{gridLineWidth}{Thickness (in pixels) of the gridlines drawn under the
chart.}

\item{independentTicks}{Only valid for y and y2, has no effect on x: This
  option defines whether the y axes should align their ticks or if they
  should be independent. Possible combinations: 1.) y=true, y2=false
  (default): y is the primary axis and the y2 ticks are aligned to the the
  ones of y. (only 1 grid) 2.) y=false, y2=true: y2 is the primary axis and
  the y ticks are aligned to the the ones of y2. (only 1 grid) 3.) y=true,
  y2=true: Both axis are independent and have their own ticks. (2 grids) 4.)
  y=false, y2=false: Invalid configuration causes an error.}

\item{...}{Additional options to pass directly to dygraphs (see the
  \href{http://dygraphs.com/options.html}{dygraphs documentation} for
  additional details).}

Axis options

\description{
Define options for an axis on a dygraph plot. Note that options will use the
default global setting (as determined by \code{\link{dyOptions}}) when not
specified explicitly.
