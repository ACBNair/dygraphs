title: "dygraphs for R"
---

The dygraphs package is an R interface to the [dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com) JavaScript charting library. It provides rich facilites for charting time-series data in R, including:

- Automatically plots [xts](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/xts/index.html) time series objects (or any object convertible to xts).
- Rich interactive features including zoom, pan, and mouseover highlighting.
- Highly configurable series display, including the ability to display custom bars (e.g. prediction intervals) around series.
- Usable at the R console as well as within [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) documents and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) web applications.

### Installation

The dygraphs package depends on the development version of the [htmlwidgets](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets) package so you need to install both packages. You can do this using the **devtools** package as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ramnathv/htmlwidgets", "jjallaire/dygraphs")
```

You can use dygraphs at the R console, within R Markdown documents, and within Shiny applications. See the [usage documentation](using.html) for more details. There are a few demos of dygraphs below as well as quite a few others in the Gallery pages linked to from the sidebar.

### Demos

Here's a simple dygraph created from a multiple time series object:

```{r}
library(dygraphs)
lungDeaths <- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths)
dygraph(lungDeaths)
```

Note that this graph is fully interactive: as your mouse moves over the series individual values are displayed. You can also select regions of the graph to zoom into (double-click zooms out).

You can customize dygraphs by piping additional commands onto the original dygraph object. Here we pipe a `dyRangeSelector` onto our original graph:

```{r}
dygraph(lungDeaths) %>% dyRangeSelector()
```

Note that this example uses the `%>%` (or "pipe") operator from the [magrittr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html) package to compose the dygraph with the range selector. You use a similar sytnax to customize axes, series, and other options. For example:

```{r}
dygraph(lungDeaths) %>%
  dySeries("mdeaths", label = "Male") %>%
  dySeries("fdeaths", label = "Female") %>%
  dyOptions(stackedGraph = TRUE) %>%
  dyRangeSelector()
```

The *Gallery* includes many more examples of the various features available to customize dygraphs.
